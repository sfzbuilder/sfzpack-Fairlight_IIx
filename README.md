## Author's desires about the distribution and usage of these samples

The author of the original Fairlight IIx Library _(known as Domain, d1g1n3rd)_ made understand to users that people are libre to distribute and use the samples, including commercial use for your songs. The only restriction is: <b>DO NOT SELL THIS LIBRARY.</b> As long you provide the library for free, there won't be any issue.

This is based on a conversation with the author, formal wording on the use and distribution of these samples is still awaited.
